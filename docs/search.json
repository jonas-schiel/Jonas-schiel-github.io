Then you have to create an empty csv file and paste the data into it. I did this for each season then used a for loop in python to combine the csv files. Once they were all combined I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.\n\nSpotrac\n\nThis source did not have an option to download, however they did approve of copying/downloading their tables so long as it was not scraped from the HTML nor used commercially. For each season, I copy and pasted the table into an excel file and converted it into a csv file. I then used a for loop to combine all the csv files, each with a distinct year. I then cleaned this data.\n\nPutting it together\n\nI merged the datasets by Team and Year after they had been cleaned and prepared.",

The data contains the variables PF (points scored in a season), win_pct (win percentage), avg_age (average player age per team), and the other variables mentioned in the introduction. There is a total of 224 observations.\n\n\nRelationship between Active Roster Spenidng and Win Percentage (excluding 2025)\n\n\n\nalt\n\n\nThis graph shows the relationship between win percentage and how much a team is paying their roster over the last 6 seasons (2019-2024). We can see that there is a slight positive relation that varies slightly season by season. Overall, teams that are willing to spend more to acquire more talented players do tend to see benefits in terms of the team’s winning percentage.\n\n\nTotal Cap by Team over the last 7 seasons\n\n\n\nalt\n\n\nThis plot shows team’s total spending over the last 7 seasons (2019-2025). Team spending has increased significantly in just the last 7 seasons. It would be interesting to look at how much of this is due to inflation and how much can be attributed to increased NFL revenue.\n\n\nAge and Offensive Production\n\n\n\nalt\n\n\nThis graph shows the imapct between a team’s average age and their production in terms of points scored by year. Interestingly, we can see that in earlier seasons (2019-2021) it appears there actually was a slight positive relationship between an increase in average age and the amount of points a team scored that year. However, it appears this effect has disappeared in recent years (2022-2025). It would be interesting to take a deeper look and try and identify possible causes for this.\n\n\nImpact of Dead Cap on Active Spending and Win Percentage\n\n\n\nalt\n\n\nThis plot shows the realtionship between a teams dead cap spending and there active roster spending. As one would expect there is some negative relationship between dead cap and active roster spending. Seeing that the darker spots also trend more towards the bottom of the graph, we can also infer that dead cap spending can also hurt a teams win percentage as their spending becomes more limited.",
